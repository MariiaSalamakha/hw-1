    <h2>What does it mean gitignore files ?</h2>
    <p>
     The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.<br>
      <br>
    A local .gitignore file is usually placed in the root directory of a project. You can also create a global .gitignore file and any entries in that file will be ignored in all of your Git repositories.<br>
      <br>
    To create a local .gitignore file, create a text file and name it .gitignore (remember to include the . at the beginning). Then edit this file as needed. Each new line should list an additional file or folder that you want Git to ignore.<br>
      <br>
    The entries in this file can also follow a matching pattern.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
           *  is used as a wildcard match
        </li>
        <li>
           / is used to ignore pathnames relative to the .gitignore file
        </li>
        <li>
           #  is used to add comments to a .gitignore file
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul><strong>There are also some git commands:</strong>

        <br>

        <li>git revert <em>Is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one).</em>
        </li>
        <li>git reset <em>Will take your branch back to a certain point in the commit history</em>
        </li>
        <li>git rebase <em>Will simply drop merge commits from the todo list, and put the rebased commits into a single, linear branch</em> 
        </li>
        <li>git cherry-pick <em>Duplicates a commit already in the current history, it will become empty</em>
        </li>
        <li>git stash <em>Command can help you to (temporarily but safely) store your uncommitted local changes - and leave you with a clean working copy</em>
        </li>
    </ul>
